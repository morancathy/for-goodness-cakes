# For Goodness Cakes

Application emulates figma hand-off from UX team with idea of turning a bakery’s Instagram into a working web application.  Site allows baker to showcase goods, update an announcement bulletin, receive Calendly consultation appointments, and receive emails of all orders and 'contact me' submissions. Site allows users to browse goods, schedule a consultation, submit an order and email the baker directly from the site.
